# About this App

![App UI](https://github.com/Jerrysuper123/reactProject1/blob/main/project1/App.png)

This App is created to entertain myself and family with jokes during the pandemic. One day I found an interested open-source API called [Joke API](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/). So I decided to use it for my React project.

Curently, this app is hosted on [Firebase](https://laughdailyapp.web.app/).

If you wished to download this code base, use below code to start your app in local host:

```bash
    npm start
```

# Design architecture

![design](https://github.com/Jerrysuper123/reactProject1/blob/main/project1/jokeApp.png)

* Use React axios to fetch Json data from Joke App by using useCallback and UseEffect to handle the side-effects in React
* Upon receiving the Json data, present each joke in a card, with joke category and type as the title
* When user clicked "re-fetch" jokes again, use useCallback to call the API_end point again
